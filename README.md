# Ninja Web Application Development Framework, version 2.x (release)

Ninja is a rock solid boilerplate for you to build web apps using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (jQuery), PHP 5.3+ & MySQL. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It lets you skip the very initial decisions and thinking that goes beyond developing web apps. Ninja is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way â€“ and in some cases to discourage alternatives. We make sure you do it too using best practices & code from our years of experience in iterative development.
